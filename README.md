The Lorenz system is a system of differential equations designed to model atmospheric convection. It is one of the simplest systems that exhibits a strange attractor: a structure where orbits are attracted, but in a chaotic and non-periodic way.

This project focusses on generating videos of the Lorenz Attractor and examining how different particles take different paths.
